    <h3>What is Beef Wellington?</h3>

    <p>Beef Wellington is a classic and elegant dish that consists of beef tenderloin coated with pâté or a duxelles (a mixture
    of finely chopped mushrooms, onions, shallots, and herbs), wrapped in puff pastry, and baked until the pastry is golden
    brown and the beef is cooked to perfection. The dish is named after Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, who was a
    British military and political figure.</p>
    
    <p>The process of making Beef Wellington involves searing the beef to seal in the juices, spreading a layer of pâté or
    duxelles over the beef, and then wrapping it tightly in puff pastry. The pastry-wrapped beef is typically chilled or
    rested before being baked in the oven. The pastry creates a crisp and flaky crust while insulating the beef, allowing it
    to cook evenly and retain its tenderness.</p>
    
    <p>Beef Wellington is often served with a rich sauce, such as a red wine reduction or a creamy mushroom sauce, to
    complement the flavors of the beef and the pastry. It is a popular dish for special occasions or gourmet meals, known
    for its luxurious presentation and delicious taste.</p>
    
    <p>While the traditional version of Beef Wellington uses beef tenderloin, variations may exist using other cuts of beef or
    even alternative proteins like chicken or fish. The core idea of encasing a protein in puff pastry remains consistent
    across different interpretations.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Farenheit</li>
        <li>Season and sear the beef with salt and pepper. Heat some olive oil in a pan over high heat. Sear the beef until all
            sides are browned. This helps seal in the juices and adds flavor. Remove the beef from the pan and let it cool.</li>
        <li>If using pâté, spread a layer of pâté evenly over the cooled beef. If using duxelles, spread a layer of the mushroom
        mixture over the beef.</li>
        <li>If desired, lay slices of prosciutto over the pâté or duxelles to add flavor and moisture.</li>
        <li>Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour. Roll out the puff pastry dough into a large rectangle that is large enough
        to completely enclose the beef.</li>
        <li>Place the pâté or duxelles-coated beef in the center of the rolled-out puff pastry. Carefully wrap the pastry around the
        beef, ensuring it is completely sealed. Trim off any excess pastry if necessary. You can use the beaten egg wash to
        brush the edges of the pastry to help seal it.</li>
        <li>Brush the entire surface of the pastry with the beaten egg wash. You can also use the back of a knife to create
        decorative patterns on the pastry if desired.</li>
        <li>Transfer the wrapped beef to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake in the preheated oven for about 35-40
        minutes or until the pastry is golden brown and crispy. The internal temperature of the beef should reach your desired
        level of doneness (e.g., medium-rare, medium). You can use a meat thermometer to check the temperature.</li>
        <li>Remove the Beef Wellington from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before slicing. This allows the juices to
        redistribute and ensures a more tender result.</li>
        <li>Slice the Beef Wellington into thick portions and serve with your preferred sauce and side dishes.</li>
    </ol>

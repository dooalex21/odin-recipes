   <h3>What is Bulgogi?</h3>
   
    <p>Bulgogi is a popular Korean dish that consists of marinated and grilled or stir-fried slices of beef. The name "bulgogi"
    translates to "fire meat" or "grilled meat" in Korean. It is known for its tender and flavorful meat, typically made
    from thinly sliced beef such as ribeye or sirloin.</p>
    
    <p>The marinade for bulgogi is key to its delicious taste. It typically includes a combination of soy sauce, sesame oil,
    garlic, ginger, sugar, and sometimes pear juice or other sweeteners. The marinade helps to tenderize the meat and infuse
    it with a savory and slightly sweet flavor.</p>
    
    <p>To prepare bulgogi, the beef slices are marinated for a period of time, usually a few hours or overnight, to allow the
    flavors to penetrate the meat. After marinating, the beef can be cooked in various ways, such as grilling on a barbecue,
    pan-frying in a skillet, or stir-frying in a wok.</p>
    
    <p>Traditionally, bulgogi is served with a variety of accompaniments, including rice, lettuce leaves for wrapping the meat,
    ssamjang (a spicy soybean paste), and various side dishes like kimchi, pickled radishes, and sesame spinach. The meat
    can be enjoyed on its own or wrapped in lettuce with rice and condiments for a delicious and interactive eating
    experience.</p>

    <p>Bulgogi is a popular dish in Korean cuisine and is enjoyed both in casual settings and at special occasions. Its
    combination of savory, sweet, and slightly smoky flavors makes it a favorite among meat lovers.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
   
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, minced garlic, grated ginger, rice wine or mirin (if using), and
        optional ingredients like pear juice or grated pear, honey, or chili flakes/paste. Mix well until the sugar is dissolved
        and the marinade is well combined.</li>
        <li>Place the thinly sliced beef in a shallow dish or a resealable plastic bag.</li>
        <li>Pour the marinade over the beef, making sure it is evenly coated. Massage the marinade into the meat to ensure it is
        well distributed.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish or seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours, or ideally overnight, to allow the flavors to
        infuse into the meat.</li>
        <li>Heat a grill, grill pan, or skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Once the cooking surface is hot, add the marinated beef slices in a single layer. Reserve any excess marinade for
        basting.</li>
        <li>Cook the beef for 2-3 minutes on each side until it is nicely browned and cooked through. You can adjust the cooking
        time based on your desired level of doneness.</li>
        <li>If desired, you can brush the beef with the reserved marinade while cooking to add more flavor and moisture.</li>
        <li>Remove the cooked beef from the heat and let it rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked bulgogi to a serving plate.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle sesame seeds and chopped green onions on top as garnish.</li>
        <li>Bulgogi is typically served with a side of steamed rice and various accompaniments such as lettuce leaves, ssamjang
        (spicy soybean paste), and side dishes like kimchi and pickled vegetables.</li>
        <li>To eat, place a piece of bulgogi on a lettuce leaf, add some rice and desired condiments, wrap it up, and enjoy!</li>

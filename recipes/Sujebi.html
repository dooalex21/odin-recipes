    <!--description of the dish-->
    <p>Sujebi is a traditional Korean dish that consists of hand-torn dough flakes cooked in a savory soup. The dough is
    typically made with wheat flour, water, and sometimes other ingredients like salt or oil. The dough is rolled out into a
    thin sheet and then torn into irregular pieces, giving it a rustic appearance.</p>
    
    <p>The soup for sujebi is usually prepared with a base of anchovy or beef broth, which is seasoned with soy sauce, garlic,
    and other flavorings. It often includes various vegetables such as zucchini, potatoes, onions, and scallions. Additional
    ingredients like clams, mushrooms, or tofu can also be added for extra flavor and texture.</p>
    
    <p>To make sujebi, the torn dough flakes are added to the boiling soup and cooked until they become soft and chewy. The
    dish is typically served hot and enjoyed as a comforting meal, especially during colder seasons. Sujebi is known for its
    simple yet satisfying taste and is a popular dish in Korean cuisine.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <p>Prepare the dough flakes</p>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, water, and salt.</li>
        <li>Knead the mixture until it forms a smooth dough. If the dough is too sticky, you can add a little more flour.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
        
        <p>Prepare the soup base</p>
        <li>In a large pot, bring the anchovy or beef broth to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the soy sauce, minced garlic, sesame oil, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine the flavors.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to a simmer and let the soup base cook while you prepare the other ingredients.</li>
        
        <p>Prepare the sujebi soup</p>
        <li>Roll out the rested dough on a floured surface until it is about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Tear the rolled-out dough into irregular pieces, roughly 2-3 inches in size. The size and shape of the dough flakes can
        vary.</li>
        <li>Add the zucchini, potatoes, onion, green onions, mushrooms (if using), clams (if using), and tofu (if using) to the
        simmering soup base. Cook for about 5 minutes until the vegetables are slightly tender.</li>
        
        <p>Cook the sujebi</p>
        <li>Gently drop the torn dough flakes into the soup one by one, making sure they are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Allow the sujebi to cook for about 5-7 minutes or until the dough flakes become soft and chewy. Stir occasionally to
        prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.</li>
        
        <p>Serve</p>
        <li>Ladle the sujebi soup into bowls, making sure to include a generous amount of the dough flakes, vegetables, and broth.</li>
        <li>Garnish with additional chopped green onions if desired.</li>
